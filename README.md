# XCalc-Rewrite

Welcome! This is the repository for XCalc-Rewrite, a version
of my previous XCalc program, rewritten from the ground up
in C++, this time with many more features, usefulness and
code quality than my original attempt.

# Compiling
To compile, follow these steps:

```
cmake -B build/
cmake --build build/
```

After that, run xcalc-rewrite(.exe if you have that) in
the `build` directory and you should be ready!
